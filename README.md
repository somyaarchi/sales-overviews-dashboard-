Business Requriements 
Design a dynamic Power BI dashboard that tracks key metrics—Sales, Profit, and Quantity—across four regions: Central, East, South, and West. The dashboard should allow users to filter by year and dynamically switch between the three metrics (Sales, Profit, and Quantity). Additionally, it should include a comparison with the previous year's (PY) sales for the selected year.

 Sales by State:
Bubble Map: Display a bubble map to visualize sales distribution across different states. The size of each bubble should correspond to the sales volume, allowing users to quickly identify states with high or low sales.

Bar Chart: Place a bar chart alongside the bubble map to provide a detailed breakdown of sales by state. This chart should allow for easy comparison between states, with bars sorted either in ascending or descending order of sales.

Create a table/grid to display key metrics for both current and previous years. The table should include the following columns:

CY Sales: Current Year Sales

PY Sales: Previous Year Sales

YoY Sales: Year-over-Year Sales growth or decline

CY Profit: Current Year Profit

PY Profit: Previous Year Profit

YoY Profit: Year-over-Year Profit growth or decline

CY Qty: Current Year Quantity

PY Qty: Previous Year Quantity

YoY Qty: Year-over-Year Quantity growth or decline
